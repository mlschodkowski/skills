name: review
description: Review the changes since a fixed point (commit, branch, tag, or merge-base) along two axes — Standards (does the code follow this repo's documented coding standards?) and Spec (does the code match what the originating issue/PRD asked for?). Runs both reviews in parallel sub-agents and reports them side by side. Use when the user wants to review a branch, a PR, work-in-progress changes, or asks to "review since X".

# Review

Apply the [plain writing standard](../references/plain-writing.md) to findings and summaries. State the evidence, impact, and needed change without theatrical language.

Two-axis review of the diff between `HEAD` and a fixed point the user supplies:

- **Standards** — does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec** — does the code faithfully implement the originating issue / PRD / spec?

Keep the two axes separate so standards findings do not hide spec findings.

## Process

### 1. Pin the fixed point

Whatever the user said is the fixed point — a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`, etc. Don't be opinionated; pass it through. If they didn't specify one, ask: "Review against what — a branch, a commit, or `main`?" Don't proceed until you have it.

Capture the diff command once: `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` (three-dot, so the comparison is against the merge-base). Also note the list of commits via `git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline`.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. Issue references in the commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`, GitLab `!67`, etc.) — fetch them with the repo's available CLI or browser tools when access is available.
2. A path the user passed as an argument.
3. A PRD/spec file under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/` matching the branch name or feature.
4. If nothing is found, ask the user where the spec is. If they say there isn't one, the **Spec** sub-agent will skip and report "no spec available".

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written. Common locations:

- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `CONTEXT.md`, `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, per-context `CONTEXT.md` files
- `docs/adr/` (architectural decisions are standards)
- `.editorconfig`, `eslint.config.*`, `biome.json`, `prettier.config.*`, `tsconfig.json` (machine-enforced standards — note them but don't re-check what tooling already checks)
- Any `STYLE.md`, `STANDARDS.md`, `STYLEGUIDE.md`, or similar at the repo root or under `docs/`

Collect the list of files. The **Standards** sub-agent will read them.

### 4. Run the two review passes

Run the Standards pass and the Spec pass as separate pieces of work. If sub-agent tools are available, use them in parallel. If not, do the two passes yourself in this order:

**Standards pass**

- Read the standards-source files from step 3.
- Read the diff.
- Report every place the diff violates a documented standard. Cite the standard file and the changed file or hunk.
- Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls.
- Skip anything tooling already enforces.

**Spec pass**

- Read the spec source.
- Read the diff.
- Report requirements that are missing or partial, behavior that was not requested, and implementation that looks wrong despite matching the words of the spec.
- Quote or cite the spec line for each finding.

If the spec is missing, skip the Spec pass and note this in the final report.

### 5. Aggregate

Present the two reports under `## Standards` and `## Spec` headings. Do **not** merge or rerank findings — the two axes are deliberately separate so the user can see them independently.

End with a one-line summary: total findings per axis, and the worst single issue (if any) flagged.

## Why two axes

A change can pass one axis and fail the other:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking the other.
